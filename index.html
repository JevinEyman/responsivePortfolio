				<h2>Some Fun Facts:</h2>
				
				
				<p>I was born and raised in Ocala, FL.  I was raised by both of my parents who are still together.  I have an older brother.  Anyone that has an older sibling can attest that being the youngest can be very hard. It made me tough and resilient.  I pride myself on hard work and dedication. I graduated high school with honors in 2002 and went on to attend College of Central Florida, University of North Florida, and graduated from Flagler College with a Bachelor of Science degree in December of 2008.  I am a state certified Emergency Medical Technician.  I am pursuing a career change into the tech industry to become a website developer. I am currently attending Coding BootCamp at the University of Miami studying the Fullstack Developer curricullum. Please check out my portfolio and connect with me on social media. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great day. </p>

				<p>I started running in elementary school over 25 years ago.  My love and passion for staying active and being fit has allowed me some tremendous opportunity.  The dedication and training associated with these races spreads to other aspects of my life.  I strive every day to be motivated and to be the best version of myself as possible.</p>
